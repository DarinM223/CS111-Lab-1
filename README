Limitations:
-Our program doesn't parallelize commands inside subshells, meaning that (echo hello ; echo world)
will always print out hello then world. 

Our choice of implementation if the spec is unclear:
- Newlines after complete commands separate 2 commands if outside of subshell.
  e.g. cat a
       echo b
  are two separate commands in command_stream.

- Multiple newlines are treated as a single semicolon if inside of subshell.
  e.g. (cat a
        echo b)
  is interpreted as (cat a; echo b).
